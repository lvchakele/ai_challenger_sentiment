## Introduction
This repo contains code for AI Challenger 2018 aspect-level sentiment analysis. With proper tuning and ensemble, it achieves the third place in test B. 
I haven't include the ensemble part since it is not elegant by my standard. This repo is presented as a preliminary try for good Tensorflow coding style. Its efficient multi-gpu implementation enables faster iteration. It also provides good logging and configuration facility.

## How to run it
To run it, simply use

python main.py --name <your_experiment_name>

It shall read the contents in data, creates output/<your_experiment_name>ã€‚

Have fun tuning!
